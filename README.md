Nice ‚Äî here‚Äôs a ready-to-use README.md for a project called AI Vision: Key Typing via Eye & Voice Control. You can copy-paste this into your GitHub repo and edit any project-specific details (model names, dataset links) as needed.

AI Vision ‚Äî Key Typing via Eye & Voice Control
Overview

AI Vision: Key Typing via Eye & Voice Control is an assistive computer-vision system that lets users type and control the keyboard using eye gaze and voice commands. It combines real-time gaze tracking (for selecting keys) with speech recognition (for direct text input and commands) to provide a hands-free typing experience ‚Äî useful for accessibility, hands-free control, and AR/VR interfaces.

Features

Real-time eye-gaze tracking to select on-screen keys.

Voice input and voice commands for faster text entry and control (e.g., ‚Äúspace‚Äù, ‚Äúdelete‚Äù, ‚Äúenter‚Äù).

On-screen keyboard UI with dwell-click or blink-to-click options.

Lightweight CNN / landmark-based gaze estimator and optional calibration step.

Configurable dwell time, blink sensitivity, and language for speech recognition.

Tech Stack

Python 3.8+

OpenCV, MediaPipe or dlib (face/eye landmarks)

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (gaze / blink models)

SpeechRecognition / VOSK / DeepSpeech (offline or online speech-to-text)

PyAudio (microphone input)

Tkinter / PyQt / HTML+JS (keyboard UI)

Installation
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-vision-eye-voice-typing.git
cd ai-vision-eye-voice-typing
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Run the app (camera + microphone required):

python app.py


Calibrate by following on-screen instructions (look at target points).

Use gaze to highlight keys; dwell or blink to select a key.

Speak to enter words or commands: e.g. ‚Äúhello‚Äù, ‚Äúspace‚Äù, ‚Äúdelete‚Äù.

How it works (brief)

Face & eye detection: detect facial landmarks and crop eye regions.

Gaze estimation: use a lightweight model or geometric method to map eye features to screen coordinates (after calibration).

Key selection: map gaze coordinates to keys on an on-screen keyboard; activate selection with dwell time or blink.

Voice control: speech-to-text runs parallel; speech inserts text or triggers commands (space, enter, delete).

Fusion: combine gaze and voice for faster and more accurate typing (e.g., voice suggests words, gaze selects them).

Evaluation & Metrics

Typing speed (words per minute, WPM)

Selection accuracy (correct key activations / total attempts)

False activation rate (unintended key presses)

Latency (ms) and CPU/GPU usage

Demo

Include a short GIF or YouTube link here showing calibration, gaze selection, and voice typing in action.

Dataset & Models

Use publicly available gaze datasets (e.g., MPIIGaze) for training or custom-collected, device-specific calibration data.

For speech, use pre-trained offline models (VOSK) or cloud APIs for higher accuracy.

Future Improvements

Predictive text and autocorrect integration.

Multilingual voice support.

Improved robustness under glasses / low light.

Mobile / AR headset adaptation.
